          Investor relationship services are primarily a combination of finance,
          communication, and marketing to manage the flow of information between
          a company, its investors, and its stakeholders. Investors play a major
          role in the success and growth of a company. Itâ€™s important for
          companies to maintain strong, transparent relationships with
          investors.
