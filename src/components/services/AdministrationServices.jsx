          <strong>Fund Accounting:</strong> Fund accountants track all purchases, sales, and other transactions related to the fund’s investments,
          ensuring accuracy and completeness in recording these activities. <a className='text-primary' href='/nav-administration-services'>Fund accountants</a> determine the value of the fund’s
          investments, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets, using relevant valuation methodologies such as market
          value, fair value, or net asset value (NAV).

          <strong>Fund Administration Services:</strong> Fund administrators handle investor onboarding, communications, and reporting, including
          processing subscriptions, redemptions, and distributions. Fund administrators ensure compliance with regulatory requirements,
          maintain corporate records, and facilitate governance processes such as board meetings and investor reporting.

          <strong>Compliance Services:</strong> Compliance services refer to the range of activities and processes undertaken by businesses and
          organizations to ensure that they adhere to relevant laws, regulations, standards, and internal policies. These services are
          designed to mitigate legal and regulatory risks, uphold ethical standards, and maintain the integrity of operations. In the context
          of alternative investment funds advisors in India like Inspigience, compliance services play a crucial role in ensuring that all
          activities related to managing alternative investment funds (AIFs) are conducted by applicable laws and regulations.
