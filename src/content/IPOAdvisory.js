    question: "Why is IPO advisory service important?",
    answer: (
      <span>
        IPO stands for Initial Public Offering. IPO (Initial Public Offering) is
        the offering of shares to the public in order to raise funds for a
        company. The IPO advisory is a type of investment banking firm that
        specialises in initial offerings for companies that are eligible to be
        listed on the SME (Stock Market Exchange). IPO advisory is important
        because it helps private firms get listed on a stock exchange for more
        growth and expansion of the firm on a large basis. The IPO advisory
        helps before and after the IPO listing. They are professionally well
        organized to communicate with well-planned strategies. The advisory
        assists the company to enter into the equity share market and prepares
        the registration certificate with the security exchange and commission.
        It also provides in-depth information about the company to the
        investors, so they have proper knowledge of the company before
        investing. Inspirigence provides the best IPO advisory service in India.

  {
    question: "What does an IPO advisor do?",
    answer: (
      <span>
        An IPO advisor is an investment banking firm that helps private
        companies raise funds through IPOs, which are Initial Public Offerings.
        Private companies enter the stock exchange market with the help of IPO
        advisory and get listed in the equity share market. It assists both
        private firms in their pre- and post-IPO listing processes, as well as
        providing investors with information about the companies that are listed
        on the SME (Stock Market Exchange) for public offerings. Inspirigence is
        the best IPO advisory in India which also generates an accurate
        investment proposition and creates arising plans for the communication

    question: "What criteria determine eligibility for launching an IPO?",
    answer: (
      <span>
        Certain eligibility criteria must be met to launch an IPO. These
        criteria serve as a strong base and make the entire process a little
        better. <br />
        <strong>Financial Performance:</strong> A record of profit is a must, as
        it depicts the company’s potential to generate good earnings and attract
        investors. Along with it an applicable balance sheet to show the
        debt-to-equity ratio. <br />
        <strong>At least three years of experience:</strong> To initiate the
        company’s initial public offering (IPO), the applicant or company
        promoting it must submit annual reports to the National Stock Exchange
        (NSE) covering the preceding three crucial years. Additionally, the
        applicant company must provide a certificate to the NSE regarding the
        following terms: <br />
        <strong>Audited Financial Statements:</strong> The last 3-5 years of
        audited statements are mandatory and are prepared by the account’s firm
        or the company’s CA. <br />
        <strong>Certificate of Incorporation:</strong> It’s a certified copy
        that confirms the company’s existence and its incorporation date. <br />
        <strong>Legal Opinion:</strong> This is given by a qualified lawyer
        verifying whether the company can legally issue the shares following all
        the rules and regulations. <br />
        <strong>
          Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association (MOA & AOA):
        </strong>{" "}
        These documents give traces of the company’s purpose, objectives, and
        internal governance structure. These are general documents that are
        required during the launch of the IPO. However, the documents may vary
        depending on the NSE’s rules and regulations and the company’s
        situation. For better guidance, you can always get in touch with
        Inspirigence and get your documents sorted. <br />
        <strong>Paid-up Capital:</strong> The issued price of the capitalization
        product multiplied by the number of equity shares for post-issue is
        known as capitalization. The applicant’s capitalization should not be
        less than 25 crores, nor should its paid-up equity share capital be less
        than 10 crores. It is necessary to consider the post-paid-up issue of
        equity share capital for which the listing is requested.

    question: "Why do companies go public?",
    answer: (
      <span>
        The term “going public” means a business or company getting listed on
        the NSE (National Stock Exchange) offering the sale of securities to the
        public and taking funding from the public. Companies go public with the
        help of an IPO (Initial Public Offering). Inspirigence also comes under
        one of the best IPO consultants in India, guiding you to get public
        offerings and managing the first calls of earnings.

  {
    question: "What are the prerequisites before launching an IPO?",
    answer: (
      <span>
        The company’s paid-up capital is the amount of money a company receives
        from the investors/shareholders in the IPO. According to the criteria
        requirements, it’s compulsory for companies to have at least 10 crores
        as paid-up capital. The minimum eligibility criteria are met based on
        IPO equity share capital and the least percentage are put forward in an
        IPO when it is declared. The net worth (assets – liabilities) of the
        company appearing in the IPO must be at least 1 crore for each of the
        previous 3 years. Rs. 3 crore of tangible assets for each of the 3
        previous years. A maximum of 50% of the assets must be carried in
        monetary assets. Rs. 15 crore should be the average operating profit
        from the last 3 preceding years. Inspirigence is one of the best IPO
        consultants in India and best IPO advisory, which provides all the

    question:
      "How long does the IPO process typically take from initial planning to listing on the Stock Market Exchange?",
    answer: (
      <span>
        The timeline varies depending on various factors. The typical IPO
        process has several factors, only some of the processes can take hardly
        1-2 weeks, while others might take 6 to 12 months. Roughly, the entire
        process could take 12 months.

  {
    question:
      "What are the potential benefits and risks of taking a company public through an IPO?",
    answer: (
      <span>
        Taking a company public through an IPO carries significant risks and
        potent benefits. An IPO enhances the company’s visibility and
        credibility; the capital infusion enables the company to fund growth
        initiatives; and the existing shareholders can sell their shares and
        monetize them. Along with these potential benefits, an IPO also has a
        few risks and challenges, such as pressure to perform well in the short
        term, market fluctuations, administrative complexity, and costs.
        Moreover, sometimes the founder’s decision might be influenced by the
        shareholders or investor’s perceptions. The major challenge is the cost,
        meaning that taking a company public via IPO includes substantial costs,
        which include several fees that might outweigh the benefits for a few
        firms.
