        question: 'What are the different types of M&A transactions?',
        answer: (
            <span>
                M&A transactions encompass various forms, each with unique characteristics. Mergers involve combining two companies into a single entity, while acquisitions occur when one company purchases another. Consolidations create a new company from multiple entities. Tender offers involve buying shares directly from shareholders. Asset purchases focus on acquiring specific assets rather than entire companies. Understanding these types helps businesses choose the most suitable approach for their strategic goals and market conditions.
